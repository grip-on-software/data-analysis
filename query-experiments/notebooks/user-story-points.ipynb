    "# Analysis of user story points changes\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to gain a better understanding of the properties of user stories regarding the size of the task. Therefore, we start off with formulating a hypothesis regarding changes made to the size of a task after awarding it initially with a number of story points (which may be based on a t-shirt sizing, in practice). Using this hypothesis, we hope to understand more about why story points change and how we could use this to improve our estimation of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find a way to improve our current backlog estimation methods by introducing a new correction factor that determines how the backlog at a current moment in time may change based on potential future adjustments to the story points. This may be used along with changes due to new stories, removed stories, and stories that have not yet been awarded points in order to generate a full backlog size estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: There is a \"correction factor\" which can be calculated from a data set of user stories. The correction factor describes the difference between a backlog based on initial awarding of points and a backlog of adjusted story points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null hypothesis**: The correction factor stays 1, regardless of the changes to user story points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we go through the ways we collect the data required for this analysis and the way we look at the statistics that we obtain from it. We also look into which statistical measures appear relevant for this analysis and how we could use them for our benefit in case we can reject the null hypothesis."
